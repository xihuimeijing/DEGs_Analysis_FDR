# The evaluation of FDR in differentially expressed genes identification
This repository contains scripts that were used to generate resutls in paper titled "Inflated false discoveries in differential expression analysis on population-level RNA-seq data".
1. transcriptomeProject.sh: This file contains all the steps to process and generate original and permuted data.
2. figure1Plots.R and figure2Plots.R: These two files were used to generate all the figures.
3. syntheticdata.R: This file contains codes to generate semi-synthetic data.
4. synthetic_subsample.R: This file contains codes to perform susampling for the semi-synthetic data.
